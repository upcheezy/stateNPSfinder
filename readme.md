### Summary:
I created this project to demonstrate my ability to perform client-side API requests on the fly. This project is meant to help a prospective explorer find all of the sites maintained by the National Park Service within each state boundary. All of the state park information is coming from the NPS web API and the photos are coming from Google Places.
